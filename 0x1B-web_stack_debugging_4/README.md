## Sky is the limit, let's bring that limit higher
In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out it’s not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests.

For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time.
